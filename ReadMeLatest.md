 1.PetWell Objective:
 The PetWell app successfully fulfills its core objective of providing accessible, affordable, and trustworthy veterinary care for pet parents.  
- Key Features Supporting Objective:  
  - Search functionality by city or pincode for easy location-based vet services.  
  - Filters for ratings, average pricing, and proximity to find the most suitable vets.  
  - Transparent information on vets with detailed profiles, ensuring pet owners can make informed decisions.  
  - Accessible design prioritizing ease of use for all pet parents, including elderly and disabled users. 
 
 2.Value Proposition:
The app delivers on its promise of simplifying pet care by connecting pet parents with reliable vet services, but some improvements (e.g., crowdsourced vet data for more transparency) could further enhance its value proposition.  
- Value Delivered:  
  - Seamless vet discovery process with easy navigation and filters.  
  - Affordable vet care options by showcasing pricing and user reviews.  
  - Crowdsourced vet data could be incorporated in future builds for even more robust, real-time information.

 3. User Privacy:
The app respects user privacy by not requiring user accounts or storing sensitive personal information.  
- Privacy Features:  
  - No login ensures anonymity.  
  - No permissions requested for functionality(User enters Pincode or city depending on their requirement) 
- Improvements Needed:  
  - Ensure compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA for any future data storage features.  

 4. App lifecycle/ state management:
State management was explicitly prioritized during development to ensure the app functions seamlessly across different stages of its lifecycle.  
- Implementation:  
  - State management ensures that user inputs (e.g., city or pincode) are preserved when navigating between pages.  
  - App supports pause/resume functionality, allowing users to return to their previous state without data loss.  
  - Persistent state management supports filters and selected vets across app interactions.

 5. Three Additional Challenges:  
The app addresses several mobile app development challenges effectively:  
- Responsive Design: Ensures accessibility across different device sizes, particularly mobile-first.  
- Offline Access: Plans to store some data locally for limited offline functionality in future builds.  
- Battery Optimization: Lightweight app design minimizes resource usage.  
- Improvement Area: Multi-platform compatibility could be addressed in future iterations by leveraging MAUI or Flutter for iOS.

 6. User Experience:  
The app provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface:  
- User-Friendly Design:  
  - Simple navigation with clear CTAs like the search bar and filter buttons.  
  - Minimalist layout ensures ease of use for elderly or less tech-savvy users.  
- Interactive Elements: Buttons are only enabled after valid input, reducing user error.  
- Future Enhancements: User feedback could be incorporated to refine user experience further.
